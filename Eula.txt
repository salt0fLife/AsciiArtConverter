Do whatever you want with this program!

Put images you wish to convert inside the "images" folder and run "run.bat" to convert to ascii art
converted images will appear inside the "exports" folder

I would recommend using lower resolution images as they look better once converted (best results below 500 x 500 pixels)

jpgs are not supported, even though the program will still attempt to convert them
